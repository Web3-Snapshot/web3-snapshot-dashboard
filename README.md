### Double Content

This version is crap, but I'm happy!

I have implemented two buttons, but can't get them to do what I want. I can't even get them to console log actually!

///////////////////////////

Also I have created two pages, Coins-1 and Coins-2 which are supposed to fetch different data.
Right now the issue is at App.js where:

`const url1` is alright 

`const url2` should be a loop that goes through all `totCryptos` and stores data of that item.

I look forward to interact ith Mr. Loxosceles on this one!
